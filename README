BSDBPQ (G8BPQ-BSD)

This is a FreeBSD-native port of G8BPQ's AX.25 packet switching system for
Linux and Windows. 

Yes, the code basically already supports FreeBSD, but, most of the conditional
macros were broken and there was a lot of leftover stuff that wouldn't have
worked anyways. 

I take absolutely no credit for this software! This was all made possible by
John Wiseman and a few other amazing people. 

Installation:
1. Install libconfig. This requires GNU Bison and Flex, it will not work with
   POSIX or BSD yacc or lex.
2. Type make in the source directory here. Parallel make is supported.
3. Copy bsdbpq to a suitable location.
4. Place your bpq32.cfg file in the same location as the bsdbpq executable.
5. Run it in some form. If you don't want to write a rc.d script for it, you
   can get away with running it from a GNU Screen or tmux session.

Note if you don't/can't have libpcap:
Compile with -DNOPCAP (edit CFLAGS in the Makefile)
